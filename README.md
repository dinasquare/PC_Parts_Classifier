# PC_Parts_Classifier
This repository features a deep learning model for classifying PC parts. The dataset was created by collecting images from Google Images, resizing them to 256 pixels, and organizing them in a hierarchical structure. Using transfer learning with a ConvNeXtXLarge model, the classifier achieves high accuracy in identifying various PC components.
